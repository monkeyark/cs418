1. create shape objects: point, line segment, trapezoid
2. parse DCEL input to point, line segment, trapezoid
3. draw planar subdivision using GTK
4. randomizing algorithm to handle input from DCEL
5. need to implement a directed acyclic graph D to store the trapezoidal map T
6. 


# Question
1. What is the input format of the DCEL? All need to convert to points and line segment eventually?
2. Test case?
3. OpenGL is NOT a library. I has different window manager (glew, glut, SDL) not cross-platform
